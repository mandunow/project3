        <p>
          During her eleven+ years with Adobe, Carol has designed a number of
          very popular text and display typefaces. Designs like Trajan,
          Charlemagne, Lithos, and Adobe Caslon are inspired by classic
          letterforms of the past - from early Greek inscriptions, circa 400
          B.C., to William Caslon’s typefaces of the 1700s. Designs like Viva
          and Nueva explore new territory while maintaining traditional roots.
          In 1994, she received the Charles Peignot award from the Association
          Typographique Internationale for outstanding contributions to type
          design. She was the first woman and only the second American to
          receive this prestigious honor.
