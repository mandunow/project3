        <h2>Carol Twombly</h2>
        <p>
          During her eleven+ years with Adobe, Carol has designed a number of
          very popular text and display typefaces. Designs like Trajan,
          Charlemagne, Lithos, and Adobe Caslon are inspired by classic
          letterforms of the past - from early Greek inscriptions, circa 400
          B.C., to William Caslon’s typefaces of the 1700s. Designs like Viva
          and Nueva explore new territory while maintaining traditional roots.
          In 1994, she received the Charles Peignot award from the Association
          Typographique Internationale for outstanding contributions to type
          design. She was the first woman and only the second American to
          receive this prestigious honor.
        </p>

          York. Some of her prominent clients include AT&T, Penguin Books, Nike,
          United States Postal Service, Sesame Street, and Target. She also
          worked with Chronicle Books, Nintendo, and Wall Street Journal, as
          well as Smart Ones, Fast Company and O Magazine. McDevitt had a degree

        <h2>Marian Bantjes</h2>
        <p>
          Having worked as a book typesetter and founding the Digitopolis
          graphic design studio, Canadian designer Marian Bantjes currently
          works on her own projects in design, art, and typography. Her
          ornamental, often dreamlike style has been featured in over 100 books,
          including her own beautiful I Wonder in 2010 (with a foreword by
          Stefan Sagmeister of the aforementioned Sagmeister & Walsh). Bantjes
          continues to bring new and unusual letterforms into the design
          vocabulary.
